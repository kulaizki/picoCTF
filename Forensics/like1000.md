In this challenge, we get a `.tar` file, so let's try to unzip that.

We can see that we now have `999.tar`, we can assume that we have 1000 `tar` files to unzip based on the challenge name.
So let's create a `shell script` that unzips the current tar file and deletes the previous file to clean it up.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

num=999

while [ $num -gt 0 ]; do
    tar_file="${num}.tar"

    if [ -f "$tar_file" ]; then
        echo "Processing $tar_file"
        tar -xf "$tar_file"

        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Extracted $tar_file"
            rm $((num + 1)).tar 2>/dev/null
            echo "Deleted $tar_file"
        else
            echo "Failed to extract $tar_file"
        fi
    else
        echo "$tar_file does not exist"
    fi

    num=$((num - 1))
done

echo "Processing complete."
```

Let's run the script.

Now we unzip all the tar files, and reach `1.tar`. We get `flag.png` so let's display that.

There we have our flag! ;D
