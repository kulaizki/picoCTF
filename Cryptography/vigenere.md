In this challenge, we get a text file.

```bash
kulaizki@GEL picoctf % cat cipher.txt
rgnoDVD{O0NU_WQ3_G1G3O3T3_A1AH3S_2951c89f}
```

Knowing the challenge name, and the description gave us a key, we can input that text into a vigenere cipher decoder.

`picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_2951a89h}`

And just like that, we found our flag! ;D
